=========================================
== Features to add to Agilifier
=========================================
- More configurability (of paths etc), so that it can be applied to project trees that have different structures
- Support for multiple releases/modules within the project, so that we can get summaries for multiple teams sharing a codebase
- Better prettification of FIT output HTML, so that it looks like the rest of the site
- Build Agilifier with Agilifier, so that we eat our own dog food and notice where the pain is
- Support for Exactor, so that it can be used beyond FIT
